# ChesstitY

This is not yet functional command-line chess-game written in C

It was my first attempt to write a non-trivial project in any language.
As I am more interested in honing my general problem-solving skills, rather than learning any particular language or framework or a "correct way" to implement something, I challanged myself by at one hand only using standard library functionallity (except for testing) and at the other hand not doing any research on how a chess game would usually be implemented.

More than wanting to write a fully functional chess game, my goal with this one is to experiment with the language C and programming in general.

The most complete image of what has been implemented so far can probably be gathered by simply running `make test` inside of `src`. To create the tests I have been using the unity testing framework by throw-the-switch.
