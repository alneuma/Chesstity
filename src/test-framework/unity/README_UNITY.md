# About Unity

**Unity** is a great unit-testing framework for C. Maintained by the people from [Throw The Switch](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/) and generously published with the MIT-License. The full project can be downloaded from their [website](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) or directly from the respective [github-repository](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity)

The files `unity.c`, `unity.h` and `unity_internals.h` are part of this original project.

The very small additions that I made are added to the end of the `unity.c` file and inside of the `unity_chess_extension.h` file.

The MIT-License information can be found inside of the file `LICENSE_UNITY.txt`.
